# Flutter-apps-created-with-Stacked
Here you find links to list of flutter apps develop using Stacked (filledStacks)

I had issues finding open source flutter apps created using Stacked that I can learn from. So i created this repo to help other developers with the same challenges. You can also reach out to me to drop links to your apps or other great apps you know of that is built using the filledStacks team's recommended approach to building flutter app.
